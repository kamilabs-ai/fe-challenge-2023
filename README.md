# FE-Challenge-2023
This is a coding challenge to evaluate candidates interested in joining the Front-End team at Kamiverse.

## Introduction
To-Do Project challenge for Front-End Developer (Using React and TypeScript)
## Objective
The objective of this challenge is to showcase the skills of candidates as a front-end developer by building a To-Do list web 
application using React and TypeScript. The application should allow users to add, edit, and mark tasks as completed, 
as well as persist the data in the browser.

## Requirements
1. **Design and Layout:** Design a clean and user-friendly interface for the To-Do application. It should include a header, a task input field, a task list, and a footer section.
2. **Task Input Field:** Implement a text input field where users can enter their tasks. When users press the "Enter" key or click an "Add" button, the task should be added to the list.
3. **Task List:** Display the list of tasks. Each task should have a checkbox to mark it as completed and an edit button to modify the task.
4. **Task Editing:** Allow users to edit a task directly in the task list. Clicking on the edit button should convert the task into an editable input field.
5. **Task Completion:** Users should be able to mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox. Completed tasks should have a visual indicator (e.g., strikethrough text).
6. **Local Storage:** Implement functionality to store the tasks locally in the browser's storage using TypeScript. The tasks should persist even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.
7. **Clear Completed Tasks:** Add a button in the footer to clear all completed tasks from the list.
8. **Responsive Design:** Ensure that the application is responsive and works well on different devices and screen sizes.
9. **Error Handling:** Implement appropriate error handling for invalid inputs or actions that cannot be performed.

## Technical Guidelines
1. Use React and TypeScript to build the application.
2. Organize your components and hooks into separate files and directories.
3. Use modern React and TypeScript practices, including functional components, hooks, and proper typing.
4. Utilize local storage for data persistence in the browser.
5. Make the interface visually appealing and intuitive for users.
6. Implement event handlers to handle user interactions.
7. Use CSS or a CSS preprocessor (e.g., SCSS) for styling.
8. Ensure your code is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices.

## Submission
1. **Source Code:** Provide the link to your public GitHub repository containing all the source code files for the To-Do list web 
application. This should include all the necessary React and TypeScript files, along with any other assets required 
to run the application.
2. **Live Link (Optional):** Optionally, you can deploy the website on a hosting platform and provide the live link. 
This will allow the reviewers to interact with the application directly.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
1. **Functionality:** Successful implementation of all required features, such as adding tasks, editing tasks, completing tasks, and clearing completed tasks.
2. **User Interface:** Design and layout of the To-Do application, as well as user experience.
3. **Code Quality:** Clarity, organization, and maintainability of your React and TypeScript code.
4. **Data Persistence:** Proper implementation of local storage for task persistence.
5. **Responsiveness:** How well the application adapts to different screen sizes.
6. **Error Handling:** Effective handling of user input errors and actions.
7. **React and TypeScript Best Practices:** Proper use of React components, hooks, and TypeScript typings.
8. **Creativity:** Any additional features or improvements you may have added.

**‚ùóNote:** If you have any questions or need further clarifications during the assignment, feel free to reach out for assistance.
Best of luck with your To-Do project using React and TypeScript!
